# ScalaJS workshop step 2. Scala.js-React Router

In this step you will introduce a Scala.js-React router (coming as a component from Japgolly's Scala.js-React implementation which will route to two pages - main page at / (the root) and photo page at /photo/some_photo_id .

Steps:

* Add the [Scala.js-React](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react) dependency as per [setup documentation](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react/blob/master/doc/USAGE.md#setup) (include also "extra"-s)
* Introduce router in Main.scala ([documentation](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react/blob/master/doc/ROUTER.md))
* Add "dummy" pages for each route
* Test that both routes work and show the apprpriate pages
